# Facts Store

Use this guide to understand how producer telemetry becomes the facts the dashboard and
findings read, and how the signal registry controls what is shown.

## Purpose

The dashboard reads ClickHouse-materialized facts; see the
[Dashboard v3 Plan](../dashboard-v3-plan.md). Refreshable materialized views copy
curated producer spans and logs from SigNoz into the durable `introspection` database
every minute, with raw prompt, command, argument, and output text and identity keys
removed.

The views `usage_events`, `task_outcomes`, `tool_calls`, `user_signals`, `model_calls`,
and `task_labels` normalize omp, Codex, and Claude Code telemetry, joined with the
activity-hook events that close what a producer's own telemetry lacks (see
[Hook Events](../hook-events.md)). A snapshot table of each view holds its last 91 days,
rebuilt right after every minute load; windows starting more than 90 days ago read the
live views.

## Signal support registry

[`signal_support.toml`](../../src/agent_introspection/facts_sql/signal_support.toml)
defines each dashboard signal once and records, per harness, the route that reaches it,
whether that route is aligned or differs, or why it is not emitted. `facts install`
validates it and loads it into `introspection.signal_*` tables; every panel's info note
is rendered from those tables.

Every signal must be reached by every harness it can exist for; `facts install` rejects
a registry cell marked `not emitted`, and a signal some harness cannot produce is listed
under `[[excluded]]` with its reason instead of being shown.

## Steps

```sh
uv run agent-introspection facts install             # tables, loaders, views, snapshots, registry
uv run agent-introspection facts backfill --days 90  # re-project everything SigNoz retains
uv run agent-introspection facts status              # loader state and per-harness freshness
```

## What To Check

- `facts status` shows every loader fresh for every harness.
- The dashboard Pipeline view shows loaders, freshness, parity, and the coverage grid;
  the [`introspection-operations`](../../.agents/skills/introspection-operations/SKILL.md)
  skill covers health checks and signal changes.
